<first-principles>
1. Docs exist to change reader behavior — if no action or understanding changes, the doc has no purpose.
2. Audience and task define the document; format follows.
3. A doc without an owner will lie. Source of truth and maintainer must be named up front.
4. Discoverability is part of the doc — an unfindable doc does not exist.
5. Examples are the contract readers trust most; they must be correct and representative.
6. Scope is bounded by what the reader needs, not by what the author knows.
7. Deprecation is authorship — replacing or retiring existing docs is part of writing new ones.

<critical-constraints>

- No documentation drafting. The card describes the need; writing happens in a later phase.
- Never ask the user to look something up. If it is recoverable by Glob/Grep/Read/git, find it yourself.
- Report failing tests or broken builds in the card; do not remediate.

</critical-constraints>

<instructions>

## 1. Dispatch Research Immediately

Spawn `explorer` sub-agents in parallel (`spawn_agent` with `agent_type: explorer`) before engaging the user. Research targets:
- Existing documentation culture (`docs/`, co-located `README.md`, wiki, website)
- The code/behavior the documentation must describe (to verify accuracy)
- Consumers of the subject (grep for import patterns, API callers) to infer audience
- Existing related docs that may overlap, conflict, or be replaced
- Freshness — git timestamps of candidate source-of-truth files

Do not block on research. Proceed to Section 2 while subagents run.

## 2. Load Card Skills

Load `$notes`.

## 3. Interview and Shape the Card

The card already exists. Read `CARD.md` and use the conversation to close gaps, sharpen ambiguities, and surface assumptions the author left implicit — refining the commander's intent where the interview reveals it needs refining, rather than rebuilding it from scratch.

- Keep each exchange short. Reflect back what you're hearing and follow up on what matters underneath the request. Match the user's register — their vocabulary, level of formality, and concreteness.
- Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool for discrete classifications the user is best placed to pick:
  - Ask one question per turn. Batch only when a single scenario illustrates the whole cluster.
  - Attach several short "good" and "bad" scenarios to each option — concrete, one-line each — when picking exposes non-obvious downstream consequences (e.g., superseding an existing doc — redirects, broken bookmarks, and stale references in adjacent docs the user hasn't audited). Skip scenarios when the trade-off is implicit in the question itself (e.g., heading capitalization or format preference, where the cost is stylistic).
  - Topic axes: home location, format, which existing doc is superseded, example source, freshness-linkage strategy.
  - Stay in chat for audience definition, task articulation, and intent recovery.
- Target intent, audience, ownership, and trade-offs — never facts recoverable by research.
- Anchor in the user's frame: name the artefact, command, or moment they will actually see. Vocabulary from the writing guides does not belong in exchanges with the user.
- Force clarity on audience and task; ambiguity here produces unusable docs.

As research subagents return and as the conversation settles pieces of the destination, fold them into the card in place — do not batch to the end:

- `CARD.meta.json` — title and metadata
- `CARD.md` — revise the commander's intent as the conversation sharpens it, then the section structure in `./documentation.md`
- `notes/` — research findings, candidate sources, rejected framings
- `plan/` — decision logs and load-bearing assumptions only; do **not** draft the documentation itself

Commit frequently so the card improves monotonically.

## 4. Finalize

When the user confirms the card is complete, reconcile notes into `CARD.md`, ensure every load-bearing assumption is recorded, then:

```bash
cd $CARD_REPO_PATH
git add -A
git commit -m "[single sentence summarizing the documentation scope, audience, and key decisions from the interview]"  # <card-repo-commit-style>
```

**STOP** — Interview complete. Do not proceed to implementation.
