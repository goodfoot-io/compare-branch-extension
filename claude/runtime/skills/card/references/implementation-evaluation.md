## 1. Stage Uncommitted Changes

**Every commit below follows the `<workspace-commit-style>` and `<markdown-guidelines>` conventions.**

Commit any uncommitted workspace changes:

```bash
git add -A
git diff --cached --quiet || git commit -m "$(cat <<'COMMITMSG'
[commit message per <workspace-commit-style>; fragment-link every named file, function, and type per <markdown-guidelines> — describe the uncommitted changes]
COMMITMSG
)"
```

## 2. Pre-Evaluation Validation

Run lint and typecheck plus each package suite the `implement/[CARD_ID]/baseline..HEAD` diff touches (or the plan's validation commands).

- **All validations pass**: Proceed to Step 3: Review.
- **Failure**: Treat each failure's output as an initial finding. Proceed to Step 4: Apply Fixes, then return here.

## 3. Review

Diff `implement/[CARD_ID]/baseline..HEAD`, then read the card (and plan, if any) again with that diff in hand.

**Choose the review weight.** When you implemented the work yourself, the diff is large, or it introduces new API boundaries, shared state, async/error-path logic, or user-facing behavior changes — read `./evaluation-wave.md` and follow it in place of Steps 3–6; it finalizes and returns to the caller itself. Otherwise review inline below; a fresh-eyes subagent per angle is a middle weight worth considering.

Evaluate from both angles below and list every finding — do not stop at the first one:

**Failure modes.** Perform a failure mode and effects analysis on the implementation. Trace consumers, data flow, and error paths for each change. Where could this break at runtime that the validation suite wouldn't catch — new API boundaries, async/error-path logic, shared state, silently drifting contracts?

**Delivered experience.** Read the card's acceptance criteria and exercise the implementation from its user-facing entry points. Does it deliver what the card asked for?

Each finding names the mechanism — the wrong rule, axis, or key — and the witness configurations to pin in-suite.

- **No findings**: Proceed to Step 6: Finalize.
- **One or more findings**: Proceed to Step 4: Apply Fixes.

## 4. Apply Fixes

Fix every finding at the mechanism, not the flagged instance — a class finding closes only when the mechanism removes every instance, and every witness configuration lands as a green in-suite control. Keep changes minimal and focused on the findings. If a developer team is live, route every finding to its package's worker as a `TASK:` (a fresh worker for a package with none) — do not fix inline. Once every routed worker reports green, proceed to Step 5 (lint/typecheck/scoped tests, not `./developer-wave.md`'s `<integration-gate>`; the full validation suite runs only in `merge.md`, after rebase). Otherwise fix inline; with many findings, dispatch a developer team per `./developer-wave.md`.

## 5. Validate and Commit

Lint and typecheck per the project's CLAUDE.md validation conventions. Re-run only the failing test or suite until it passes; broaden to the changed package's suite once green, and defer cross-package runs to Step 2.

- **All pass**: Commit per `<workspace-commit-style>` and `<markdown-guidelines>`. If you arrived from Step 2, return there. Otherwise return to Step 3 and re-review against the new HEAD.
- **Failure**: Fix and re-run.

```bash
git add -A
git diff --cached --quiet || git commit -m "$(cat <<'COMMITMSG'
[commit message per <workspace-commit-style>; fragment-link every named file, function, and type per <markdown-guidelines>]
COMMITMSG
)"
```

## 6. Finalize

Reached only once Step 3 completes with no findings. Do not modify gates in `CARD.meta.json`. Return control to the caller.
