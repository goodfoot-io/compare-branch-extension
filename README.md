## Compare Branch vs GitLens

If you're looking for a lightweight alternative to GitLens specifically for branch comparison:

| Feature        | Compare Branch    | GitLens          |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| Focus          | Branch comparison | All git features |
| Speed          | ⚡ Instant        | Slower           |
| AI Workflow    | ✅ Optimized      | ❌ Not optimized |
| Cost           | Free              | $0-19/mo         |
| Complexity     | 📦 Lightweight    | 💼 Feature-heavy |
| Startup Impact | None              | Noticeable       |

**When to use Compare Branch:** You need fast, focused branch comparison without feature bloat.

**When to use GitLens:** You need comprehensive git history, blame annotations, and team collaboration features.

Many developers use both: GitLens for history and blame, Compare Branch for reviewing changes.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Does this work with AI coding agents like Claude Code or Cursor?**
A: Absolutely! Compare Branch is specifically optimized for AI coding workflows. It's lightweight (won't slow down your IDE or agent), provides instant PR previews when agents finish work, and auto-detects branches created by agents. Many developers use it as their primary tool for reviewing AI-generated code.

**Q: How is this different from using git diff in the terminal?**
A: While AI coding agents work great in terminals, Compare Branch provides a visual tree view that makes it much faster to review large changesets. Instead of scrolling through terminal output, you get an organized, clickable file tree with instant diffs—perfect for validating agent work before merge.

**Q: Can I use this while an agent is working?**
A: Yes! Compare Branch is non-blocking and uses progressive loading. You can browse changes while agents run in the background. The view auto-refreshes when agents commit new changes.

**Q: How is this different from GitLens?**
A: Compare Branch is focused specifically on branch comparison with optimized performance. GitLens is a comprehensive Git toolset with many features, some requiring a paid subscription. If you only need branch comparison, Compare Branch is faster and simpler. Think of it this way: if GitLens is a Swiss Army knife, Compare Branch is a laser-focused scalpel.

**Q: Can I compare any two branches?**
A: Yes! Use "Change Source Branch" to select any branch as your comparison base.

**Q: Does this work with large repositories?**
A: Yes! Progressive loading ensures the extension remains fast even with thousands of changed files—especially important when reviewing large AI-generated changesets.

**Q: Can I see the diff for deleted files?**
A: Yes, clicking a deleted file shows a diff between the base version and empty state.

**Q: Does this support monorepos?**
A: Yes, the extension works with any git repository structure.

**Q: Does this work with Cursor, Windsurf, or VSCodium?**
A: Yes! Compare Branch is fully compatible with all VSCode-based editors. It's available on both VS Code Marketplace and Open VSX Registry.
