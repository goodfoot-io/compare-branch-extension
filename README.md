Compare Branch is a performance-optimized VS Code extension that provides comprehensive branch comparison in a hierarchical tree view. See all differences between your working branch and its target without leaving your editor.

**Built for development teams working with:**
- AI coding assistants that generate multi-file changes
- Feature branch workflows requiring pre-merge review
- Large codebases with complex directory structures
- Git workflows that benefit from visual change navigation


### Flexible Branch Comparison

<img src="https://github.com/goodfoot-io/compare-branch-extension/raw/main/images/branch.gif" alt="Compare git branches in VS Code - automatic upstream branch detection and manual branch selection for pull request preview" width="100%">

Compare against any branch, commit, or tag. Automatic upstream detection with manual override when needed.

**Solves:** Manual branch selection overhead. Zero configuration required.

### Integrated Search

<img src="https://github.com/goodfoot-io/compare-branch-extension/raw/main/images/search.gif" alt="Search changed files in VS Code branch comparison - quickly find modified files in large AI-generated changesets" width="100%">

Quickly locate specific files within large changesets.

**Solves:** Finding files when AI agents modify 50+ files simultaneously.

### Dual View Modes

<img src="https://github.com/goodfoot-io/compare-branch-extension/raw/main/images/modes.gif" alt="Git diff tree view modes - toggle between changed files only and complete directory tree with changes highlighted" width="100%">

Toggle between "Changed Files" for focused review or "All Files" to see changes within full directory context.

**Solves:** Need for both focused review and full repository context.

### Status-Based Filtering

<img src="https://github.com/goodfoot-io/compare-branch-extension/raw/main/images/filter.gif" alt="Filter git changes by status - view only modified, added, deleted, or renamed files in branch comparison" width="100%">

Filter by modified, added, deleted, or renamed files.

**Solves:** Navigating large changesets by focusing on specific change types.

### Native Diff Integration

<img src="https://github.com/goodfoot-io/compare-branch-extension/raw/main/images/diff.gif" alt="VS Code git diff viewer integration - single-click side-by-side branch comparison for any file" width="100%">

Single-click access to VS Code's diff viewer for any file.

**Solves:** Eliminates manual `git diff <file>` commands for individual files.

## AI Coding Workflows

Modern AI coding assistants can modify dozens of files per operation. This creates specific challenges for code review.

### Common Pain Points

**Volume Overwhelm:** AI agents frequently modify 10-50+ files per task. Standard terminal diffs become difficult to navigate at this scale.

**Context Switching:** Moving between terminal-based AI tools and IDE for review creates friction in the development workflow.

**Validation Requirements:** Teams need to verify AI-generated code before merging, requiring file-by-file review capability.

### Supported AI Platforms

The extension integrates seamlessly with:

- **Claude Code** — Anthropic's terminal-based coding agent
- **GitHub Copilot** — Industry-standard AI pair programmer
- **Cursor** — AI-integrated code editor
- **Windsurf** — Collaborative AI development environment
- **Cline** — Open-source VS Code AI agent
- **Aider** — Terminal-based AI pair programming
- **Continue** — Privacy-focused AI assistant with local model support
- **Bolt.new** — Browser-based AI coding platform

### Workflow Integration

**Pre-execution validation:**
Review your branch baseline before delegating work to AI agents. Ensure correct starting state.

**Post-execution review:**
Examine all AI-generated changes in a unified interface. Navigate file-by-file for thorough validation.

**Real-time monitoring:**
Auto-refresh capability enables live review as AI agents create commits. Non-blocking architecture ensures no performance impact.

**Parallel development:**
For teams using git worktrees with multiple AI agents, Compare Branch enables comparison across different working directories.

## Usage Guide

### Branch Comparison

The extension displays all files that differ between your current branch and the selected source branch (typically main or develop).

**View modes:**
- **Changed Files** (default) — Modified files only
- **All Files** — Complete directory tree with changes highlighted

Toggle via toolbar icon.

### Source Branch Selection

**Automatic detection (recommended):**
Reads upstream branch configuration from git. Updates automatically when you switch branches or pull changes.

**Manual selection:**
Click the branch selector icon to choose any branch, commit, or tag. Return to automatic mode via "Enable Auto-Detect Source Branch" command.

### File Operations

**Single file:**
- Click to open diff view
- Right-click for context menu (open, compare, copy path, reveal in explorer, rename, delete, etc.)

**Multiple files:**
- `Cmd`/`Ctrl` + click for multi-select
- Right-click for bulk operations
- Drag and drop support (when enabled)

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Enter` — Open diff for selected file(s)
- `Cmd+C` / `Ctrl+C` — Copy file path(s)
- `Delete` — Delete selected file(s) with confirmation

---

## Commands

Access via Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`):

- **Compare Branch: Change Source Branch** — Select different comparison target
- **Compare Branch: Enable Auto-Detect Source Branch** — Return to automatic detection
- **Compare Branch: Refresh** — Manually trigger view refresh
- **Compare Branch: Switch to All Files Mode** — Display complete file tree
- **Compare Branch: Switch to Changed Files Mode** — Display changed files only

---

## Security Verification

Verify downloaded releases by comparing checksums:

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
sha256sum compare-branch-*.vsix
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
Get-FileHash compare-branch-*.vsix -Algorithm SHA256
```

Compare output with the checksum in `checksums.txt` from the release.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Does this work with AI coding assistants?**
Yes. The extension monitors git state and works with any tool that creates commits, including all major AI coding platforms.

**How does this differ from terminal git diff?**
Terminal diffs work well for reviewing small changes. For navigating modifications across many files and directories, a tree-based interface provides superior context and efficiency.

**Can I use this while an AI agent is working?**
Yes. Non-blocking architecture with automatic refresh as commits are created.

**How does this differ from GitLens?**
GitLens provides comprehensive git functionality. Compare Branch focuses on branch comparison. Choose based on your specific workflow requirements.

**Can I compare any two branches?**
Yes. Use the "Change Source Branch" command to select any branch, commit, or tag.

**Does it support large repositories?**
Yes. Progressive loading maintains performance with repositories containing 10,000+ files.

**Can I view diffs for deleted files?**
Yes. Clicking a deleted file displays the diff showing removed content.

**Does this work with monorepos?**
Yes. Supports any git repository structure.

**Is this compatible with VS Code forks?**
Yes. Works with Cursor, Windsurf, VSCodium, and other VS Code-based editors. Available on Open VSX Registry.
