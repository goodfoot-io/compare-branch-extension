- Updates when you switch branches or pull changes

**Manual Selection**:

1. Click the branch icon in the toolbar
2. Select a branch from the quick pick menu
3. Return to auto-detection with **Enable Auto-Detect Source Branch**

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Does this work with AI coding agents like Claude Code or Cursor?**
A: Absolutely! Compare Branch is specifically optimized for AI coding workflows. It's lightweight (won't slow down your IDE or agent), provides instant PR previews when agents finish work, and auto-detects branches created by agents. Many developers use it as their primary tool for reviewing AI-generated code.

**Q: How is this different from using git diff in the terminal?**
A: While AI coding agents work great in terminals, Compare Branch provides a visual tree view that makes it much faster to review large changesets. Instead of scrolling through terminal output, you get an organized, clickable file tree with instant diffs‚Äîperfect for validating agent work before merge.

**Q: Can I use this while an agent is working?**
A: Yes! Compare Branch is non-blocking and uses progressive loading. You can browse changes while agents run in the background. The view auto-refreshes when agents commit new changes.

**Q: How is this different from GitLens?**
A: Compare Branch is focused specifically on branch comparison with optimized performance. GitLens is a comprehensive Git toolset with many features, some requiring a paid subscription. If you only need branch comparison, Compare Branch is faster and simpler. Think of it this way: if GitLens is a Swiss Army knife, Compare Branch is a laser-focused scalpel.

**Q: Can I compare any two branches?**
A: Yes! Use "Change Source Branch" to select any branch as your comparison base.

**Q: Does this work with large repositories?**
A: Yes! Progressive loading ensures the extension remains fast even with thousands of changed files‚Äîespecially important when reviewing large AI-generated changesets.

**Q: Can I see the diff for deleted files?**
A: Yes, clicking a deleted file shows a diff between the base version and empty state.

**Q: Does this support monorepos?**
A: Yes, the extension works with any git repository structure.
