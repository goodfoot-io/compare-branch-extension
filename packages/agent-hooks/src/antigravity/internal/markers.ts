/**
 * Conversation-scoped runtime marker store for the Antigravity `runtime` hooks.
 *
 * The Antigravity adapter is a set of one-shot subprocesses: unlike the
 * OpenCode plugins, no state survives between hook invocations, so the
 * launcher-facing protocol lives entirely on disk. Every handler terminates
 * its conversation's protocol in exactly one durable marker:
 *
 * | Marker | Written by | Meaning |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `ready` | PreInvocation | Registration, card context, and watcher setup succeeded; the launcher may proceed. |
 * | `failure` | any handler | The contract failed at `stage` with `reason`; the launcher must fail the action. |
 * | `route` | PostInvocation | A route step was injected this session (`merge` or `shutdown`). |
 * | `idle` | PostInvocation | The decision machinery ran and required no next step. |
 * | `drain-ready` | Stop | Idempotent cleanup finished; the launcher may settle. |
 *
 * Markers live under `<cards-config-dir>/antigravity/runtime/markers/`, keyed
 * first by the Cards session id the launcher exported pre-spawn (the launcher
 * knows it without parsing host storage), then by the host conversation id.
 * When an input is too broken to carry a conversation id (or the session env
 * is missing), the marker lands under the `unattributed`/`unknown-conversation`
 * placeholders instead of being dropped — a failure the launcher cannot see is
 * a failure that hangs until timeout.
 *
 * @summary Conversation-scoped marker store for the Antigravity runtime hooks
 * @module internal/markers
