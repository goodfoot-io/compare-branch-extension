/**
 * WorktreeCreate hook that creates a Cards-managed git worktree.
 *
 * Fails closed: any error on the create path is rethrown so the runtime exits
 * non-zero and the harness aborts launch. When the worktree is card-bound, it
 * is registered with the Cards API via `createWorktreeForCard` — discovery
 * failure (no client) throws rather than leaving an unregistered worktree on
 * disk. Unbound worktrees skip the API entirely: the parent branch is recorded
 * as `branch.<name>.cardsParent` git config and the worktree is added to the
 * per-session unbound-candidate set so `cards create` can bind it later. The
 * worktree path is returned only after `settle` resolves, ensuring symlinks and
 * node_modules rerouting are complete before the agent uses the directory.
