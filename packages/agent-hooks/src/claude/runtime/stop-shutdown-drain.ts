/**
 * Stop hook — Claude shutdown drain readiness acknowledgement.
 *
 * Correlates a pending `cards shutdown` request against a strict, fail-closed
 * idle check (tracked subagents plus the launcher-owned process tree) and only
 * then signals readiness back to the action dispatcher over the request's
 * per-action socket. Matcher-less so it composes alongside `stop.ts`'s
 * unattributed-commit check in the same Stop event group; each hook is
 * independent and neither blocks nor depends on the other.
 *
 * @summary Stop hook — Claude shutdown drain readiness acknowledgement
 * @see https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks#stop
