 * Loads the authoritative worktree path policy for one worktree creation.
 *
 * Reads `.worktreeignore` and `.worktreeinclude` from the source root — both
 * gitignore syntax, parsed with the `ignore` library — and classifies every
 * git-ignored path into one of three decisions made before any ignored path is
 * provisioned into the worktree:
 *
 * - `omit` — matched by `.worktreeignore`; never provisioned.
 * - `copy` — matched by `.worktreeinclude`; copied as a real file into the
 *   worktree, and any ignored ancestor directory is prevented from being
 *   symlinked.
 * - `share` — the default for unmatched ignored paths; symlinked into the
 *   worktree.
 *
 * Omit wins over copy. Matching sees through symlinked directories: the
 * descendants of git-ignored symlink entries (the workspaces node_modules
 * shape) AND of TRACKED symlink entries under node_modules subtrees (links
 * committed with `git add -f`, which the git-ignored enumeration never
 * reports) are synthesized so rules addressing a package's interior match
 * and the rerouter materializes the package instead of recreating the link.
 * The TRACKED phase is scoped to exactly the node_modules trees the rerouter
 * owns — root `node_modules` plus each glob-matched workspace package's
 * `node_modules`, both derived from `package.json` `workspaces` — and a
 * TRACKED node_modules-segment symlink outside those trees fails closed
 * naming the path: no pass can enforce a rule on it, and the checkout's link
 * left in place would let worktree-side writes reach the source.
 * The policy fails closed: a readable-but-invalid, unreadable, or otherwise
 * unprocessable config file — or an enumeration phase that outlives its
 * shared fail-closed deadline — surfaces as a {@link WorktreeIncludeError}
 * before any matching source path can be linked into the destination. The
 * deadline budget defaults to 30000ms and is configurable via the
 * `CARDS_WORKTREE_POLICY_TIMEOUT_MS` environment variable (milliseconds;
 * the timeout message names it when a budget is exceeded).
 * Repository-relative paths stay normalized to POSIX form (forward slashes)

 * resolves through the recreated link into the source checkout. This phase
 * lists every tracked file's index mode (`git ls-files -s`), keeps the

 * tracked links the rerouter's materialization walk can act on, derived from
 * the same {@link enumerateOwnedNodeModules} list the mirror uses — and feeds
 * them through the same see-through synthesis the ignored enumeration uses,
 * so matcher matches and the omit-ancestor materialization cover tracked
 * package interiors too. The entry paths themselves are matched as well
 * (mirroring the ignored enumeration, where git reports the link), so a
 * directly matched tracked entry is handled as a directly copied path instead
 * of being materialized.
 *
 * A TRACKED node_modules-segment symlink OUTSIDE the owned trees fails closed
 * naming the path: no pass ever reaches that tree, so a rule on it would
 * silently no-op and the checkout's link would stay in place — a worktree-side
 * write at the ruled path escaping the worktree. The invariant: a tracked
 * node_modules-segment symlink is either inside owned trees where the policy
 * fully applies, or creation fails loudly.
