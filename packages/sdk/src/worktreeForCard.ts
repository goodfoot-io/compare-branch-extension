 * 5. Set per-worktree `core.hooksPath` (idempotent git config --worktree).
 * 6. Append `.cards/CARD_ID` and `.cards/CARD_ORIGINAL_HOOK_PATH` to git excludes.
 *
 * **API phase** — `client.addBranch(...)` under the cross-process advisory bind
 * lock. No client-side pre-check (that would reintroduce the TOCTOU); the store's
 * upsert semantics make a re-run safe.
 *
 * **Attribution phase** — when `transcriptPath` is supplied, run
 * {@link spawnAdhocAttribution}. Activation is deliberately NOT written here — it
 * stays inside `adhoc-cleanup`, preserving the invariant that an `active` card
 * always has a live monitor and ref. The activatable-status guard and de-dupe
