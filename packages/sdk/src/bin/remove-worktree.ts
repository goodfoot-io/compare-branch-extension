/**
 * CLI entrypoint for removing Cards-managed git worktrees.
 *
 * Accepts a single worktree path argument. When the worktree is card-bound (a
 * `.cards/CARD_ID` marker is present), its branch record is also unregistered
 * via `removeWorktreeForCard`; a missing client or a failed `removeBranch` is
 * logged to stderr but does not fail the command (fail-open on branch
 * unregister). Unbound worktrees fall back to the bare `removeWorktree`. The
 * command exits 0 when the worktree is removed, even if the branch unregister
 * failed.
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 success, 2 usage or worktree-removal failure.
 *
 * @summary CLI for git worktree removal
