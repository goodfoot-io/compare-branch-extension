/**
 * Shared API request and response types for the Cards V2 REST API.
 *
 * These types define the wire-level contract between clients and server.
 * Both the server (for validation) and clients (for request construction)
 * compile against these shapes to ensure compatibility across the ecosystem.
 *
 * Request types model JSON payloads sent in HTTP bodies or query strings.
 * Response types model the JSON structures returned by endpoints. All
 * timestamps use ISO 8601 format for consistent parsing across platforms.
 *
 *
 * @summary Shared API request and response types for the Cards V2 REST API
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Creating a card
 * const request: CreateCardRequest = {
 *   title: 'Implement auth flow',
 *   description: '## Goals\n- OAuth2 support',
