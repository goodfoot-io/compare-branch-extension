/**
 * Core card metadata for the Cards V2 protocol.
 *
 * These shapes model the metadata stored in `CARD.json` as well as the
 * derived card object used by the UI and APIs. The metadata fields are the
 * canonical source of truth for card identity and lifecycle state.
 *
 * Cards follow a directory-based storage model where each card lives in its own
 * folder containing `CARD.json` (metadata), `DESCRIPTION.md` (description),
 * optional plan documents, attachments, and typed files.
 *
 *
 * @summary Core card metadata for the Cards V2 protocol
 * @example
 * ```json
 * // CARD.json metadata
 * {
 *   "id": "main-0001",
 *   "title": "Implement authentication",
 *   "status": "active",
 *   "tags": ["feature", "security"],
 *   "gates": {
 *     "planRequired": true,
 *     "planApproved": true,
 *     "mergeRequestRequired": true,
 *     "mergeApproved": false
 *   },
 *   "isPinned": false,
 *   "order": 1,
 *   "repositoryId": "main"

// --- Card Gates ---

/**
 * Gate flags that express workflow requirements and approval state for a card.
 *
 * Gates enforce development process discipline by requiring certain milestones
 * before a card can progress. The `*Required` flags indicate what the workflow
 * demands; the `*Approved` flags track whether those requirements have been met.
 *
 * Gates are evaluated by automation and UI to decide whether a card can move
 * to a later lifecycle state. They are stored with the card so the workflow
 * intent remains durable even if tooling changes.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // A card requiring plan approval before work starts
 * const gates: CardGates = {
 *   planRequired: true,
 *   planApproved: false,  // Cannot start until approved
 *   mergeRequestRequired: true,
 *   mergeApproved: false
 * };
 *
 * // After plan is approved, card can move to active
 * gates.planApproved = true;
 * ```
