/**
 * Branch and worktree tracking types for Cards V2 workspace integration.
 *
 * These types support tracking Git branches and their associated worktrees within
 * a card's workspace. Branch metadata is persisted in separate workspace-branches.json
 * and workspace-commits.csv files, tracked with static metadata (branch name, worktree path,
 * addedAt timestamp) and derived fields computed at read time (exists, isMerged, commits).
 *
 * The branch API (`GET /cards/:id/branches`, `POST /cards/:id/branches`) uses
 * these types to expose workspace tracking state to clients and enable branch
 * association with cards.
 *
