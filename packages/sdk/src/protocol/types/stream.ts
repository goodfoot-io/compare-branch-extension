/**
 * Stream protocol types for JSONL streaming.
 *
 * A stream is an append-only JSONL file attached to a card, synced into
 * `streams/{streamType}/{relPath}` (where `relPath` may contain multiple
 * forward-slash-separated segments) by the transcript-sync engine, and
 * broadcast over WebSocket in real time. An iframe-based renderer (served from
 * the stream definition's `wwwRoot` directory) displays stream content in the
 * extension UI. Metadata lives in a sibling `.meta.json` file and is committed
 * to the card repository at stream creation and close.
