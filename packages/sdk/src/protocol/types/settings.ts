/**
 * Settings schema types for the actions-based execution system.
 *
 * This module defines the `settings.json` structure that provides composable
 * environments containing actions. Settings are loaded from project, user,
 * and default locations with complete override semantics (later sources
 * replace earlier ones for each environment key).
 *
 * The settings system replaces the older hooks-based architecture with a more
 * flexible model where:
 *
 * - **Environments** group related configurations by deployment target
 * - **Actions** define executable workflows with start/end lifecycle commands
 *
 *
 * @summary Settings schema types for the actions-based execution system
 * @example
 * ```json
 * // settings.json
 * {
 *   "environments": {
 *     "default": {
 *       "version": 1,
 *       "description": "Standard development workflow",
 *       "actions": [
 *         {
 *           "name": "Start Work",
 *           "description": "Begin implementation session",
 *           "command": { "command": "npx claude-code" },
 *           "supportsBackgroundMode": true
 *         }
 *       ],
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * ```

// --- Command ---

/**
 * Configuration for a shell command execution.
 *
 * Commands are executed in a shell context with the working directory set
 * to the workspace root. Environment variables from the parent process are
 * inherited, and additional card-specific variables are injected.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const command: Command = {
 *   command: 'npm run build && npm test',
 *   timeout: 60000  // 1 minute timeout
 * };
 * ```

// --- Action ---

/**
 * An action that can be invoked on a card.
 *
 * Actions represent executable workflows. They appear as buttons in the
 * card UI and can run in interactive (terminal) or background mode. Each
 * action has a command that executes the workflow.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const action: Action = {
 *   id: 'implement',
 *   name: 'Start Implementation',
 *   description: 'Launch Claude Code for this card',
 *   command: { command: 'npx claude-code --card $CARD_ID' },
 *   supportsBackgroundMode: true,
 *   allowConcurrent: false
 * };

// --- Environment ---

/**
 * An environment groups related actions.
 *
 * Environments represent deployment targets or workflow contexts (e.g.,

 * environment, which determines the available actions.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const env: Environment = {
 *   version: 1,
 *   description: 'Development environment with full tooling',
 *   actions: [
 *     { name: 'Start Work', command: { command: 'npx claude-code' } },
 *     { name: 'Run Tests', command: { command: 'npm test' } }
 *   ]
 * };
 * ```

   * Stream type definitions keyed by type name (e.g., `"claude-session"`).
   *
   * Each entry configures the transform module and size guardrails for a
   * particular kind of JSONL stream. Type names must be lowercase with
   * hyphens (`/^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$/`).

   * @see StreamDefinition for the per-type configuration shape.

// --- Settings ---

 * Root `settings.json` structure containing all environments.
 *
 * Settings are loaded from multiple sources in priority order:
 * 1. Project settings (`.cards/settings.json` in workspace)
 * 2. User settings (`~/.config/cards/settings.json`)
 * 3. Default settings (bundled with the extension)
 *
 * Each environment key in later sources completely replaces the same key
 * from earlier sources (no deep merging).
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const settings: Settings = {
 *   environments: {
 *     default: {
 *       version: 1,
 *       actions: [{ name: 'Start', command: { command: 'echo hello' } }]
 *     },
 *     production: {
 *       version: 1,
 *       description: 'Production deployment workflow',
 *       actions: [{ name: 'Deploy', command: { command: './deploy.sh' } }]
 *     }

 * };
