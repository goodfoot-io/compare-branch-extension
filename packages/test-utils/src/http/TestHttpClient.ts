 * by URL.
 *
 * Constraint: this client does not model headers, status codes, or latency;
 * it is a lightweight stub for behavioral tests only.

 * Test HTTP client implementation for dependency injection testing.

 * - Stores requests in order for later inspection.
 * - Returns the same object instance stored in `responses` for a URL.
 * - Returns `{}` when no response is configured.
 *
 * Constraint: responses are not deep-cloned; mutating the returned object will
 * affect subsequent reads.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const client = new TestHttpClient();
 *
 * // Configure responses
 * client.responses.set('/api/cards', [{ id: '1', title: 'Test' }]);
 *
 * // Use in code under test
 * const result = await client.get<Card[]>('/api/cards');
 *
 * // Inspect recorded requests
 * expect(client.requests).toHaveLength(1);
 * expect(client.requests[0].method).toBe('GET');
 *
 * // Reset between tests
 * client.reset();
