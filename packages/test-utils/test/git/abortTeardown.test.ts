/**
 * Regression test: teardown's guarded `abort()` must never let the abort plugin's
 * task-promise rejection escape as a process-fatal unhandled rejection — even when
 * the SIGINT'd git child is slow to close.
 *
 * Why: replacing `clearQueue()` with `AbortController.abort()` introduced a path
 * where aborting a still-spawned git child rejects the in-flight task promise.
 * The abort plugin sends SIGINT and the rejection surfaces only when the child's
 * async `close` event fires — an arbitrary amount of wall-clock time later. A
 * guard that removed its `unhandledRejection` listener on a fixed `setTimeout(0)`
 * macrotask therefore lost the race for any child that took longer than a tick to
 * die (a commit running hooks, a large checkout, gc, CI jitter): the listener was
 * already gone when the rejection arrived, and — in the default Node
 * `unhandledRejection` mode used by the extension test host — it terminated the
 * whole process. This test proves the process-lifetime guard contains that
 * rejection regardless of how long the child takes to close.
 *
 * Mechanism: the scenario is exercised in a child Node process (default
 * unhandled-rejections mode) because the fatal consequence is only observable as
 * a non-zero process exit; every in-process listener fires regardless of the fix.
 * The child installs a slow (~0.6s) pre-commit hook and tears down ~120ms into a
 * never-awaited commit, so the child is still alive when the guard runs.
 *
 * @summary Teardown abort must not surface a fatal unhandled rejection (slow child)
 * @module test-utils/test/git/abortTeardown
