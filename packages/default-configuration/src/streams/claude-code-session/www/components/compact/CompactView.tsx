/**
 * Compact micro-card view for the claude-code-session stream renderer.
 *
 * Folds the primary stream into {@link CompactState}, adapts it into the
 * provider-neutral `CompactCardModel` via {@link claudeToCompactCardModel},
 * and renders it through the shared `CompactCard` component — the actual DOM
 * and CSS for the three-row card (liveness dot + status + timing, the
 * sanitized headline recap, and the de-duplicated metrics row, reflowing at a
 * wide viewport into recap+metrics / latest-tail panels) live there, not here.
 * Status is liveness-only (`RUNNING`/`ENDED`, with an error tint) — never an
 * asserted outcome. Streams whose primary file has no lines ask the host to
 * close the renderer so blank boxes don't show in the card detail.
 *
 * @summary Compact session card: folds state, adapts it, renders the shared CompactCard
