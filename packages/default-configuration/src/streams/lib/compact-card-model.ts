/**
 * Provider-neutral model for the compact stream card.
 *
 * Both stream renderers (claude-code-session, codex-session) produce a
 * `CompactCardModel` from their own provider-specific compact state via a thin
 * adapter, and the shared `CompactCard` component renders it. This is the
 * normalized presentational contract that lets one component and one CSS file
 * serve both providers instead of two independently-maintained compact views.
 *
 * The model is pure data — no JSX, no React nodes — so it is trivially testable
 * and the component owns all rendering (fact separators, the tail slice, the
 * subagent-label conditional).

 * @summary Shared compact-card presentational model
