 * Spawns a detached Node.js process that calls {@link cleanupMergedBranches}

 * and survives parent exit — this call does not wait for the child's actual
 * cleanup work (network discovery, git operations, up to an hour of
 * backoff), which continues fire-and-forget after this function returns.
 * Stdout and stderr are appended to the detached-child output capture when it
 * can be prepared; capture failures warn and fall back to discarded sinks so
 * cleanup remains fail-open. The child is also handed a
 * `CARDS_HOOKS_LOG_FILE` env var pointing at the same log file the parent's
 * own `logger` actually resolves to (via {@link resolveLogFilePath}), so it
 * can construct its own working `Logger` before it has parsed anything off
 * stdin, and so both processes' lifecycle events land in one file even under
 * a `CARDS_HOOKS_LOG_FILE`/`CARDS_LOG_DIR` override.
 *
 * Immediately after a successful `spawn()`, this also writes the
 * cleanup-attempt marker (see {@link writeCleanupMarker}) from the parent —
 * not the child. The parent is the only process guaranteed to run before a
 * child that dies during its own Node/ESM module bootstrap (i.e. before it
 * can log anything at all), so writing the marker here, and logging its path
 * alongside the "spawned" log line, is what lets an external observer
 * distinguish "cleanup attempt started but the child never even got far
 * enough to log" from "cleanup never attempted."
 *
 * After wiring up stdin/unref, this awaits a short, bounded race between the
 * child's own `'exit'` event and a grace-period timer
 * ({@link EXIT_GRACE_MS}). This does not observe the child's eventual real
 * exit (which can be up to an hour away) — it only narrows the blind spot to
 * "child crashed or was killed within the grace window right after spawn,"
 * catching failures that would otherwise go completely unlogged because the
 * parent process was already gone by the time they happened.
