# Card-Type References

Single source of truth for card-type guidance. Two files per card type:
- `<type>.md` — **writing guide**: target CARD.md structure.
- `interview-<type>.md` — **pre-creation interview guide**: how to reach enough signal before creating the card.

Plus one shared reference used by every card type:
- `commanders-intent.md` — first-principles guide for the opening paragraph(s) of `CARD.md`. Every writing guide and interview guide references it; do not duplicate its guidance elsewhere.

Non-type references loaded on demand from the skill body:
- `deep-card.md` — multi-file documentation-corpus card layout; loaded when the source material is a document set of three or more documents, or the user says "deep card".
- `extension-cli.md` — `cards-extension` CLI for controlling the VS Code extension host.
- `fmea-review.md` — iterative worker FMEA review loop for a card's design corpus; loaded for complex or uncertain cards, or on request.
- `launch-cards.md` — serial batch-launch procedure for a set of cards.
- `work-diagram-concepts.md` — semantics a work diagram must preserve; loaded when an HTML page's subject is the card's own work.
- `work-diagram-notations.md` — notation catalog keyed by the question the reader asks of the diagram.
- `work-diagram-style.md` — stylized-2.5D visual grammar and SVG mechanics for work-diagram pages.

## Consumers

1. **Card creation** (`$cards` skill) — loads both the interview and writing guide for the matched card type. Interview runs first; the writing guide shapes CARD.md at `cards create` time.
2. **Post-creation interview** (`$interview` skill) — routes by card type, then loads `commanders-intent.md`, `<type>.md`, and its own `interview-<type>.md`; also loads `deep-card.md` when the card repo has documentation tiers.
3. **Card planner** (`$card-planner` skill) — reads a deep card's `explanation/`, `how-to/`, and `reference/` tiers before planning.

## Generated copies

The publisher materializes the writing guides, `commanders-intent.md`, and `deep-card.md` as regular files under `public/opencode/runtime/skills/interview/references/`:

```
bug-report.md
enhancement.md
investigation.md
documentation.md
maintenance.md
operations.md
commanders-intent.md
deep-card.md
```

Edit those files here; publication refreshes every consumer from this authored source.

The `interview-<type>.md` files are deliberately not shared with `$interview`. The copies here are pre-creation — no card exists yet. The runtime skill keeps distinct post-creation copies, which interview against an existing CARD.md.

## Markdown Formatting

Fragment links, mermaid diagrams, collapsible sections, and code blocks are consolidated in the `$markdown` skill; each card-type guide references those guidelines in its writing principles.
