# Cards

Use the CLI binary below to manage cards. For direct card content operations
(comments, attachments, plans), use the card's filesystem repository — see
Card Repository below.

For controlling VS Code (opening files, running commands, sending notifications,
managing panels, controlling the debugger, etc.), load `./references/extension-cli.md`.

For launching individual cards to implement the work they describe, load `./references/launch-cards.md`.

To file a GitHub issue with the Cards extension developer, use `cards-extension issue`
(see `./references/extension-cli.md`).

The user is notified when you create a card or add a comment.

## Card Type References

Before creating a card, load the `$markdown` skill, `./references/commanders-intent.md`, and both references for the matched card type. Two references load together:
- An **interview** guide describing how to reach enough signal for the card.
- A **writing** guide describing the target CARD.md structure.

Route by the card's deliverable — what the user wants to exist when the work is done — not by surface wording. A feasibility or research question embedded in a request for a concrete change is yours to resolve (Glob/Grep/Read/git/web): answer it, fold the finding into scoping, and route by the change. When the deliverable is ambiguous, confirm in plain language what the card will do before creating it — never name the card type to the user.

Match the first applicable row:

| Card type | Interview (process) | Writing (target) |
|-----------|---------------------|------------------|
| Bug, error, crash, regression, broken behavior | `./references/interview-bug-report.md` | `./references/bug-report.md` |
| Feature, improvement, new capability | `./references/interview-enhancement.md` | `./references/enhancement.md` |
| Research the user explicitly asks to capture as a card, or too large to resolve in one session | `./references/interview-investigation.md` | `./references/investigation.md` |
| Documentation, guides, runbooks, API reference | `./references/interview-documentation.md` | `./references/documentation.md` |
| Refactor, cleanup, tech debt, upgrade, migration | `./references/interview-maintenance.md` | `./references/maintenance.md` |
| Infrastructure, CI/CD, deploy, monitoring, scaling | `./references/interview-operations.md` | `./references/operations.md` |
| Otherwise | `./references/interview-enhancement.md` | `./references/enhancement.md` |

**Deep cards.** When the source material is a document set — three or more documents, or one document the card cannot cover without omission — or the user says "deep card", additionally load `./references/deep-card.md`. It layers a multi-file documentation corpus (routing-hub CARD.md, `explanation/`/`how-to/`/`reference/`/`notes/` tiers) over the matched type's interview and intent guidance, replacing the writing guide's CARD.md body structure. A deep card is ~20 files and 6+ commits: do not load it for a single-topic request, however detailed — "comprehensive" alone is not the trigger.

Run the interview when creating a card interactively with a user: gather enough signal, then invoke the `cards create` flow below and compose CARD.md against the writing guide in the same initial commit. Skip the interview when the user asks to capture something quickly, or when another workflow dispatches here to record an issue it hit — create the card directly from what you already know, still composing CARD.md against the matching writing guide.

### FMEA review

After composing a complex or uncertain card — a deep card, a design touching security, concurrency, or data-integrity surface, or one whose failure handling you are not confident is fully specified — load `./references/fmea-review.md` and run its reviewer loop until the reviewer is satisfied, or offer it to the user when they are directing the work. Also run it when the user asks to "FMEA the card" or requests a failure-mode review. Skip it for simple, well-anchored cards.

## `cards` CLI

`cards` is a plugin-provided executable on `PATH` covering get, create, list, search, attach, action, and watch. Invoke it directly as a bare command.

**Get a card** — Fetch card details by ID. The response includes `repositoryPath` for filesystem access:
```
cards <card-id>
```

Also included:
- `isMerged: boolean | null` — `true` when all workspace commits are merged into the viewer's HEAD, `false` when commits exist but are not merged, `null` when the card has no workspace commits.
- `parentBranch` — the workspace branch the card was created from; present when the card was created in a workspace with a resolvable branch.

**Create a card** — Pipe JSON to stdin with `title` (required). Optional: `tags`, `environment`, `gates`, `relations`. Capture `repositoryPath`; every step below writes into it:

```bash
REPO=$(cards create --jsonpath '$.repositoryPath' <<'EOF'
{ "title": "Fix auth", "tags": ["bug"] }
EOF
)
```

Then, in order:

1. Load the `$markdown` skill before writing CARD.md.
2. When the card has something worth rendering — a mockup, diagram, data model, flow, or comparison of options — author an HTML page and commit each page's `.html`/`.meta.json` pair in a commit of its own; load `$html-files` for mechanics and `$design` for styling. When a page's subject is the card's own work rather than the product being built, first load the three `work-diagram-*` references (see Work-Diagram Pages below). Timeline position follows commit order: commit before CARD.md to open the card with a hero the reader takes in first, after CARD.md to elaborate what the description lays out.

```bash
cards html check "$REPO/proposed-panel.html"
cd "$REPO" && git add proposed-panel.html proposed-panel.meta.json && git commit -m "Added HTML page [single sentence describing what the page shows]."
```

3. Write CARD.md and commit:

```bash
cat <<'CARD_EOF' > "$REPO/CARD.md"
Card description here (plain markdown, no frontmatter).
CARD_EOF
cd "$REPO" && git add CARD.md && git commit -m "Added description [single sentence summarizing the current and desired behavior covered]."
```

4. Load the `$notes` skill and record research discoveries — including any approach that emerged — as notes in the card repository. Planning happens in a later step; do not write `plans/` files at creation time.

Include `relations` when the new card relates to an existing one. Each entry has a `type` (only `"related"` is valid) and a `cardId`. The CLI sets relations only at creation; edit `CARD.meta.json` afterward.

```
cards create <<'EOF'
{ "title": "Unify tag layout", "relations": [{ "type": "related", "cardId": "main-67" }] }
EOF
```

**Attach a card to a worktree** — Attach an existing card to the current linked worktree:
```
cards <card-id> attach
cards <card-id> attach --parent-branch <ref>
```

Attaching installs hooks, registers the worktree branch with the card, and enables session streaming. The command succeeds only if:
- You are in a linked worktree (not the main repository)
- The worktree has no existing card bound to it
- The card exists and is accessible
- A parent branch can be resolved (checked in order: `branch.<name>.cardsParent` git config, reflog decoration, `--parent-branch` flag, then refuses)

Outputs card-repo-log and workspace-repo-log context blocks to stdout (no env block). If the transcript path cannot be resolved, attaching succeeds with a stderr streaming-disabled warning.

**Search cards** — Search cards using a unified query syntax with `#tag`, `@relation`, and free text:
```
cards search "login bug"
cards search "#auth @main-5 login" --status active
cards search "#planning" --limit 20
cards search "@main-42"
```

Free text matches at 3+ chars. Beyond stored tags, four derived tags are filterable: `planning`, `merge-requested`, `merged`, `unmerged`.

Search responses are flattened — gates are top-level booleans and commit fields are absent.

Options: `--workspace-path <path>`, `--status <status>`, `--limit <n>`, `--offset <n>`

**Execute an action** — Execute an action on a card via the server relay:
```
cards <card-id> action <action-id>
cards <card-id> action <action-id> --background
cards <card-id> action <action-id> --background --exit-when-done
```
The action ID is the lowercase identifier from the action definition (e.g., `launch`). Requires a connected extension client.

Actions run interactively by default. `--background` is rejected with a 400 error for an action that does not support background mode. `--exit-when-done` signals the agent to exit cleanly once the action completes rather than leaving the session open.

**Signal shutdown** — From inside a running action, tell Cards the agent reached a terminal state (after a merge, after recording a blocker, after all tasks complete). Check `EXIT_WHEN_DONE` first; if true, finish or roll back in-progress commits, then:
```
cards "$CARD_ID" shutdown --outcome success|blocked|error [--message "..."]
```
Outcome defaults to `success`. Exit 0 confirms delivery; the handler terminates the session gracefully and the card still settles on `needs_review`. Without `SOCKET_PATH` the command exits non-zero — it only works inside an action.

**Watch for commits** — Block until the next unattributed commit on a card's repository:
```
cards <card-id> watch
cards <card-id> watch "src/auth/**"
cards <card-id> watch "src/auth/**" "tests/auth/**"
```
Blocks until the first eligible commit, outputs formatted commit details, attributes the commit to the current session, then exits 0. When unattributed commits already exist at invocation time, they are output immediately without subscribing. Optional glob patterns restrict output to commits where at least one changed file matches; multiple globs are OR-combined. Requires an active card session. Exits non-zero on connection failure or missing session.

### Workspace Path

The CLI auto-detects the workspace from `pwd`. Cards are scoped to the branch you're working on — in a worktree, the card belongs to that worktree's branch (e.g., branch `feature` -> prefix `feature-`).

Use `--workspace-path` only if the user explicitly requests creating a card in a different repository.

## Card Repository

Each card is an isolated Git repository. The `repositoryPath` field from `cards <id>`
gives the absolute path to this repository.

### Directory Layout

```
CARD.meta.json              # Metadata (source of truth)
CARD.md                     # Description (pure markdown, NO frontmatter)
plans/                      # Plan documents (continuation-based)
  [name].md                 # Semantically-named plan files
  [name].md.meta.json       # Sidecar with display title
comments/                   # Created on first comment
  {slug}.md                 # Descriptive semantic slug, pure markdown
attachments/                # Created on first attachment
  att-{uuid4}_{name}        # Binary content
  att-{uuid4}_{name}.meta.json
commits/                    # One file per attributed commit (infra-managed)
  {sha}                     # Filename is the full 40-hex SHA; content is `<sha>\n`
branches/                   # One file per tracked branch (infra-managed)
  {encodeURIComponent(name)}.json
```

### Commits and Branches

The `commits/` and `branches/` directories are written by Cards infrastructure, not by hand. Produce a correctly-formatted entry only when a task explicitly requires it — otherwise leave these alone.

- **`commits/`** — one file per attributed commit. The filename is the full 40-character lowercase-hex SHA (`/^[0-9a-f]{40}$/`); the content is that SHA plus a single newline (`<sha>\n`). No `.patch`, CSV, or short-SHA forms — the pre-commit hook rejects them fail-closed with `commits/: invalid commit entry filename: <name>`.
- **`branches/`** — one file per tracked branch, named `<encodeURIComponent(name)>.json`. The authoritative branch `name` lives inside the file content, never decoded from the filename. The content is the persisted `WorkspaceBranch`: `parentBranch` and `addedAt` (ISO 8601), plus optional `worktree`. Never persist the read-time `BranchInfo` fields (`exists`, `isMerged`, `commits`).

Source of truth: `COMMITS_DIR`, `BRANCHES_DIR`, and `WorkspaceBranch` in `public/packages/sdk/src/protocol/types/branch.ts`.

### CARD.meta.json

```json
{
  "id": "main-0001",
  "title": "Implement authentication",
  "status": "active",
  "tags": ["feature", "security"],
  "gates": {
    "planRequired": true,
    "planApproved": true,
    "mergeRequestRequired": true,
    "mergeApproved": false
  },
  "isPinned": false,
  "order": 1,
  "repositoryId": "github.com/org/repo",
  "relations": [
    { "type": "related", "cardId": "main-0002" }
  ]
}
```

`relations` is optional — omitted when the card has no outgoing relations.

### Work-Diagram Pages

HTML pages may be committed at any point in a card's life (`$html-files`). When a page's subject is the card's own work — its proposed decomposition and task dependencies at creation; execution history, attempts, or the decision trail afterward — rather than the product being built, first load `./references/work-diagram-concepts.md` (what to represent), `./references/work-diagram-notations.md` (which notation), and `./references/work-diagram-style.md` (visual language).

### Adding a Comment

Comments are pure markdown files with descriptive slug filenames.

```bash
REPO=$(cards <card-id> --jsonpath '$.repositoryPath')
mkdir -p "$REPO/comments"
cat <<'COMMENT_EOF' > "$REPO/comments/my-slug-name.md"
Your comment content here (plain markdown, no frontmatter).
COMMENT_EOF
cd "$REPO" && git add "comments/my-slug-name.md" && git commit -m "Added comment [single sentence summarizing the comment's substance]."
```

### Adding an Attachment

Add relevant miscellaneous files (screenshots, logs, exports) as attachments whenever the user provides or references one during card creation or comments — don't just describe it in text. If only part of a screenshot is relevant, crop it to that portion before attaching.

```bash
REPO=$(cards <card-id> --jsonpath '$.repositoryPath')
ATT_UUID=$(cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid)  # UUID4
ATT_NAME="att-${ATT_UUID}_screenshot.png"
mkdir -p "$REPO/attachments"
cp /path/to/file.png "$REPO/attachments/$ATT_NAME"
cat <<METAEOF > "$REPO/attachments/${ATT_NAME}.meta.json"
{
  "id": "$ATT_UUID",
  "name": "$ATT_NAME",
  "originalName": "screenshot.png",
  "size": $(stat -c%s "$REPO/attachments/$ATT_NAME"),
  "mimeType": "image/png"
}
METAEOF
cd "$REPO" && git add "attachments/$ATT_NAME" "attachments/${ATT_NAME}.meta.json" && git commit -m "Added attachment [single sentence describing what was attached and why]."
```

## Worktree Path Policy

`.worktreeignore` (omit) and `.worktreeinclude` (copy) at the invoking checkout's root classify ignored source paths; unmatched ignored paths are shared as symlinks. In a linked worktree, that means the linked checkout containing `pwd`, not the primary checkout behind the common Git directory. Eligibility comes from Git's `--exclude-standard` ignored/untracked enumeration (repository ignore files, repository-local `info/exclude`, and configured global excludes). Untracked non-ignored files are outside the policy and do not arrive.

- **Patterns** — each file is independently evaluated by the `ignore` library using gitignore rules, including root-anchored `/`, `**`, character classes, escapes, trailing-space rules, directory patterns, ordering, and `!` negation. A negation affects only its own file and cannot re-include a child while its parent remains excluded. Blank lines and lines whose trimmed form starts with `#` are discarded before matching.
- **Omit wins over copy** — a path matching both files is omitted. Because omitted matches are removed before copy ancestors are calculated, an include rule for that same leaf does not by itself force real ancestor directories.
- **Copy is an intersection** — only source paths that exist in Git's ignored/untracked enumeration are selected. Tracked paths are left to checkout; missing entries and entries that appear only after enumeration are not created. A source entry that disappears before copying is skipped; other stat/copy errors fail creation.
- **Directory topology** — a copied descendant prevents its collapsed ignored ancestor from being shared and copies matching ignored files recursively; ordinary unmatched siblings remain absent, even though a direct classifier query may call them `share`. An omitted descendant under such an ignored ancestor otherwise omits the collapsed directory wholesale. To prevent that collapse, a different descendant must survive as a final copy match; making the same omitted leaf an include match is insufficient.
- **`node_modules` exception** — inside root or workspace-package `node_modules`, ruled ancestors become real directories and entries are handled individually: omitted children stay absent, copied children are real, and unmatched children are symlinked. Tracked symlinks containing a `node_modules` segment outside the workspace trees this rerouter owns fail closed.
- **Copies keep their shape** — regular-file mode bits are preserved; a source symlink is recreated with the same link target text, not dereferenced, so a relative target resolves from its new location. Windows symlink creation requires Developer Mode or elevation and otherwise fails closed.
- **Regenerated per creation** — config edits take effect on the next materialization.
- **Config and failure behavior** — an absent file contributes no patterns; a readable symlink to a policy file is allowed; a dangling policy-file symlink, directory, unreadable file, invalid matcher input, policy-expansion failure, or provisioning error fails closed (`create-worktree` exit 3). The separate initial ignored-path discovery scan is a general creation failure (exit 2). Config, discovery, and policy expansion finish before policy-controlled linking, but the checkout and unrelated setup may already exist; later copy/link failures may follow partial provisioning. Settle cleanup removes the directory, registration, and only a branch created by that invocation, while reporting cleanup failure.
- **Enumeration deadlines** — initial ignored-path discovery has its own fixed 30-second Git timeout. After configs load, policy expansion shares one `CARDS_WORKTREE_POLICY_TIMEOUT_MS` budget (default `30000` ms) across per-directory Git scans, tracked-symlink scanning, and filesystem/workspace walks; those Git calls are also bounded by the remaining window.

<card-status>
- **todo**: This card is ready for implementation.
- **active**: The agent is actively working on this card. Set automatically when an action handler starts; do not set directly.
